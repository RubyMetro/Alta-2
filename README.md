While this project is still in it's Alpha phase and not release ready, you are completely free to try alta for yourself! you can report any bugs found <a href="https://.github.com/c-hristian-t/Alta-2/issues>">here!</a> please make sure to read the setup information below as it offers helpful information for setting up Alta correctly. 
  
## Setup
things to keep in mind:
  - a cdn or any similar file hosting server is required as any images are loaded from the web as apposed to locally
  - the project needs to be built/compiled and deployed manually at this time, once Alta is release ready, a release on github will be made.
  - While you may host Alta yourself, the released version of the project will be hosted by myself. <b>if you are just looking to add this bot to your server, you may do so <a href="https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=913637463786938368&permissions=8&scope=bot">with this link.</a></b>
  - As of current the Alta client does not connect to a remote database, while this may change in the future to allow different clients to use the same configuration for individual users, our database will not be accesible by your client. In the future you may need to set up your own database.
  - Slash commands are currently unavailable but will be added as soon as possible. Alta makes use of a message prefix for now.
